These programs were made as homeworks, therefore, these are my codes written according to given assignments, which were not my idea.


32-bit CPU - a simple processor processing arithmetic operations

The program accepts two to three arguments: the first is run or trace, the second is optional stackCapacity, and the last is the path to the instruction file (binary file (code in assembler converted to binary form)). Run executes all instructions and prints the CPU state, trace prints the state after each instruction and waits for Enter before executing the next one.
